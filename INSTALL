You need roundcube >= 0.8 installed.

0. Download the latest version archive from
   https://github.com/sblaisot/roundcube-topline/tags

1. Uncompress it and move it to the roundcube plugins dir :

    tar xvjf roundcube-topline-0.0.4.tar.gz
    mv roundcube-topline-0.0.4 <path_to_roundcube>/plugins/topline

2. Apply patch to your roundcube installation
   Don't be affraid by name of the patch, it has been tested against roundcube 0.8.4 as well as 0.8.3

    cd <path_to_roundcube>
    patch -p 1 < plugins/topline/roundcube-patch/roundcube-topline-0.8.3.patch

3. Add "topline" to the plugins list in <path_to_roundcube>/config/main.inc.php, for example :

    $rcmail_config['plugins'] = array('topline',);

It works :)
